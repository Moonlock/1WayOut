1WayOut - A command line adventure about surviving the zombie apocalypse.

Warning: This game is very much a work in progress.

You have been infected by a disease that slowly turns people into zombies.  As has everyone else in your town.  Fortunately, a cure exists which can restore a person even after complete zombification.  In order to survive, you must escape the town and reach the cure before losing control of yourself.  Along the way, you will run into many other townfolk at varying degrees of zombification.  Some will want to join you, some will want to eat you, and some will want to join you until they deteriorate to the point that they want to eat you.  Keep in mind that every one of them can still be cured when deciding whether you can really kill them to save yourself.

To play:
	git clone https://github.com/Moonlock/1WayOut
	cd 1WayOut/1WayOut
	./1WayOut

Once in the game, you can type 'help' at any time to list possible actions.
